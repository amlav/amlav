- 👋 Hi, I’m @amlav (aka Abby Lavoie) 
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis & statistics especially building and assessing models to help explain natural phenomena. My thesis project involved building
 an algorithm to apply to EEG data in order to predict sleep stages. 
- 🌱 I just graduated from SFSU with an MS in Statistical Data Science! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects to improve newly acquired skills. I especially enjoy projects involving human health. 
- 📫 Please feel free to email me at abby.lavoie@gmail.com, contact me on LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/in/abby-lavoie-a68987289), or send me a message on Discord (@abbylala).
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: My favorite stress-relieving activity is crochet. I once crocheted a human-sized brain (without a pattern)!
